Scikit-learn Design
Primarily, three types of objects

Estimators - It estimates some parameter based on a dataset. Eg. imputer. It has a fit method and transform method. Fit method - Fits the dataset and calculates internal parameters

Transformers - transform method takes input and returns output based on the learnings from fit(). It also has a convenience function called fit_transform() which fits and then transforms.

Predictors - LinearRegression model is an example of predictor. fit() and predict() are two common functions. It also gives score() function which will evaluate the predictions.

Feature Scaling
Primarily, two types of feature scaling methods:

Min-max scaling (Normalization) (value - min)/(max - min) Sklearn provides a class called MinMaxScaler for this

Standardization (value - mean)/std Sklearn provides a class called StandardScaler for this
